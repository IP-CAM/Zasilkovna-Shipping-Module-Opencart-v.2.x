# Module for OpenCart
Installation

    Download module file »
    Copy Content OpenCart-Master to your OpenCart's root directory.
    Log in to the administration, go to Extensions »Shipping and install the module.



    After installing the module, click the Edit button that appears instead of the Install button

    On the Edit page, enter the traffic name, price, select a country from which they are offered by 
    branches and the traffic method. Next, enter the API key and loosen the entire module. In addition, you can enter traffic tax.



    Now the right over the shipbody is offered to your customers. The target branch will always be listed in the order note.
    Possible problem: If in the OpenCart cart after choosing transport, it claims that it is not selected to the right, check 
    that you do not have a dot mode name, eg MailCřevna.cz. If so, remove it, OpenCart uses the dot to separate items and the name is then recognized.
